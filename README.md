## My Approach to System Thinking for Collibra implementations

At BearingPoint, I focus on integrating system thinking into my work to build efficient, scalable, and cohesive solutions. The Collibra ecosystem plays a crucial role in data governance and management, and the repositories I maintain are designed to streamline and enhance integration and automation processes, providing significant value to our users.

```

### API Documentation, Schema Management, and Integration Templates
The journey begins with [collibra-openapi-schemas](https://github.com/bearingpoint/collibra-openapi-schemas), which centralizes all Collibra OpenAPI schemas. This repository ensures that our API documentation is up-to-date and easily accessible, paving the way for automated client generation and documentation portals.

Next, [collibra-python-clients-generator](https://github.com/bearingpoint/collibra-python-clients-generator) automates the creation of Python API clients. This automation saves valuable development time and ensures consistency across our API clients.

With generated clients like [collibra-core-api-python-client](https://github.com/bearingpoint/collibra-core-api-python-client), [collibra-dgc-core-api-java](https://github.com/bearingpoint/collibra-dgc-core-api-java), and [collibra-importer-api-python-client](https://github.com/bearingpoint/collibra-importer-api-python-client), developers can easily integrate with the Collibra Data Governance Center. These clients provide robust interfaces for accessing core functionalities and specialized data import capabilities.

The [collibra-python-integration-template](https://github.com/bearingpoint/collibra-python-integration-template) provides a robust foundation for developing Python integrations with Collibra, incorporating best practices and powerful tools to deliver high-quality, efficient integrations.

### Infrastructure Automation
To support the deployment and management of Collibra Edge sites, [collibra-edge-gcp](https://github.com/bearingpoint/collibra-edge-gcp) provides Terraform automation scripts. This ensures that our infrastructure is scalable and easily maintainable.

### Workflow Development Templates
The [collibra-workflows-template](https://github.com/bearingpoint/collibra-workflows-template) standardizes best practices and enhances the developer experience around Collibra workflow development projects, featuring external script file management, Groovy syntax support, and dynamic resolution of external file contents.

Together, these repositories form a cohesive value stream that enhances the Collibra ecosystem, driving efficiency, consistency, and reliability in data governance and management. My personal focus on system thinking ensures that each component works seamlessly within the larger system, delivering maximum value.
